## Welcome to My Home Page

Ever since I was a kid I knew I loved data, I thought data was the ultimate truth. Today I'm living that truth out interacting with data on every level from harvesting to making real research and business decisions.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/macdonaldlowe/macdonaldlowe.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
